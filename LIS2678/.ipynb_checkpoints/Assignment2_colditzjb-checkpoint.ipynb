    "## Background:\n",
    "One overarching goal of this research project is to determine the feasibility of using the online Yelp platform to collect business listings for retailers of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS; e.g., vape shops) in Pennsylvania. To this end, I utilized the Yelp API to collect data for all metropolitan and micropolitan census regions in Pennsylvania (which includes some surrounding states). Each API call was set to maximum search radius of 25 miles, targeting a central zipcode within each identified census region (some geographic overlap was present). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data have been collected from the Yelp API at roughly 1-month intervals from September 2016 through present. Data are currently stored in CSV files. Monthly API calls were repeated using several distinct search terms such as \"vape\", \"vaping\", and \"ecig\" to maximize sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of overlap in search radii and search terms, each monthly data file contains many redundant listings. As the searches were repeated several times, search results are also redundant among the data files. Also, several results are outside of Pennsylvania, so additional data cleaning is needed to limit the scope of results to Pennsylvania ENDS retailers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data were collected as part of an ongoing research project at the University of Pittsburgh's [Center for Research on Media, Technology, and Health](http://mth.pitt.edu/) and are stored in [CRMTH's GitHub \"YelpEpi\" repository](https://github.com/CRMTH/YelpEpi/). For the purposes of this project, I forked that repo to [my personal GitHub \"YelpEpi\" repository](https://github.com/colditzjb/YelpEpi/).\n",
